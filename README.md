Notes
------------------
After happily using Liquibase for sometime with Gradle builds I wanted to make use of Liquibase in my SBT projects as well.  Doing some searching I found this excelent SBT plugin https://github.com/bigtoast/sbt-liquibase. Unfortunatly I immediatly ran into several issues around test scoped dependencies which prompted me to refresh this project and also update it to 0.13.7 plugin standards.

The plugin works as is for me but it hasn't been as throughly tested as I would like.  To address this I am working on adding scripted tests and CI builds.  Additionally I would like to add missing Liquibase tasks such as diff and get this published to Sonatype OSS and eventually Maven Central.

Please file bugs or feature requests and I will do my best to address them.

Acknoledgements
---------------
Inspiration from previous work done by others on the following projects was an enourmous help.
 * sbt-liquibase plugin for sbt 0.11/0.12 (thanks for actually making this plugin in the first place!)
 * sbt-web (helped to bring this up to speed with 0.13 plugin standarts)
 * sbt-assembly (learned a lot about scripted sbt tests)
